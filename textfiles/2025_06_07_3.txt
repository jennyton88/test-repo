Post/Log/Devlog, What will it be? Duplicate;
There are several names for the devlogs I post.;
These devlogs should be called posts. Posts are easier to say, using only one syllable. Logs also works too.

Devlog has two syllables, but it's more descriptive. "Development" + "Log" I think? That should be it. Every post is a devlog. I don't know, I still prefer "devlog" to "post".

Ending this devlog here. Bye.
